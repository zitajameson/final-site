		<p> <b>Hi again,</b></p>

		<p>I am a junior at the <a href = "https://www.si.umich.edu/">University of Michigan School of Information</a> with a concentration in Information Analysis (think data analytics!).<br>
			<br>Through my experiences with Reach Consulting Group (RCG) I have affirmed my passion for working on data-driven solutions to
			help companies optimize their performance, effectiveness, and efficiency. When working with others I feel energized to solve
			technical challenges by noticing relevant patterns and issues at the intersection of people, data, and technology.<br>
			<br>This coming summer I am joining KPMG as a Digital Lighthouse Digital Consultant Intern in the Philadelphia office!<br>
			<br>Some other facts about me - I am a native of the incredibly unique Upper Peninsula of Michigan: a nature-filled, beautiful part of the United States that has remained a secret from the world.
			Additionally, I have had the privilege of obtaining my Private Pilot's Certificate and hope to continue my aviation education throughout my life.<br>
			<br> Although I have loved living in the midwest and can not imagine living in a real city or farther than a few hours away from a Great Lake, I am eager to challenge myself and live outtside the Midwest!<br>
			<br>I would love to chat, please reach out to me through Email or LinkedIn below!
